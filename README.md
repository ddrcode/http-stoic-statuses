# HTTP Stoic Statuses

**`http-stoic-statuses`** is a metaphysical error-handling layer for APIs, websites, and machines that deserve better than a mere number. Instead of dry HTTP responses, this project returns meaningful, philosophical Latin reflections depending on the status code — all from the point of view of a chosen ancient thinker.

> Because sometimes, *404 Not Found* just isn't enough.

## Philosophers

Choose your responder:

- **Seneca (the Younger)** — Stoic calm, sorrow-tinged reason.
- **Diogenes** — Cynical, mocking, sharp-tongued truth.
- **Plotinus** — Mystical abstraction and cosmic vibes.

(*Nietzsche plugin currently in testing — handle with care.*)

## Supported Status Codes

Each status has unique responses per philosopher:

- `200 OK` — *Actum est.* / *It is done.*
- `403 Forbidden` — *Scimus te. Et tamen: non.* / *We know you. And yet: no.*
- `404 Not Found` — *Inquiris quod non est.* / *You seek what is not.*
- `418 I'm a Teapot` — *Amphora sum, non machina.* / *I am a jug, not a machine.*
- `500 Internal Server Error` — *Chaos regnat intra.* / *Chaos reigns within.*

...and more to come.
